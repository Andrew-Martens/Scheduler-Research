# Scheduler-Research
As a part of cs310: Operating Systems taught by Professor Steinwand I took a deep dive into how Schedulers work and more specifically how beneficial a contention-aware scheduler could be. 

Contention occurs when processes fight over shared resources at the hardware level and more specifically the cache and bus. In theory, optimizing the physical location processes assigned would reduce contention could boost performance at a very low level, but is the overhead of these algorithms or in some cases machine learning models too expensive to reap the benefits?

If you'd like to read more about it, the file "Contention Aware Scheduling.pdf" contains my findings.
